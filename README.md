- **Objective:** The project focuses on analyzing Verizon Communications’ financial performance by conducting a common-size and trend analysis of its SEC 10-K income statement data from 2022 to 2024.
- **Analytical Methods:** The paper applies financial tools such as ratio analysis, year-over-year growth rate calculations, and common-size income statement evaluations. These methods are supported by tables and visualizations to highlight trends in revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), gross income, interest expense, and net income.
- **Key Findings:** Results show that while Verizon’s revenue growth was modest, the company demonstrated improved cost efficiency, increased gross and net income margins, and signs of financial stability. However, a significant rise in interest expenses was identified as a concern that could affect long-term profitability.
- **Strategic Recommendations:** The paper recommends that Verizon prioritize debt reduction strategies, maintain disciplined cost controls, and explore diversification in business services—particularly in 5G and enterprise solutions—to strengthen long-term financial sustainability and investor confidence.

- **Objective:** The paper provides a comprehensive financial ratio analysis of Verizon Communications Inc. from 2022 to 2024, evaluating the company’s liquidity, operational efficiency, profitability, and financial leverage.
- **Analytical Methods:** Key ratios analyzed include the current ratio, quick ratio, inventory turnover, accounts receivable turnover, gross and net profit margins, debt-to-equity, equity multiplier, and return on equity. Tables and data visualizations support each section for clarity and interpretation.
- **Key Findings:** The analysis revealed weakening short-term liquidity and fluctuating profitability, particularly in 2023, followed by signs of recovery in 2024. Verizon demonstrated strong asset utilization and gradual deleveraging, suggesting improving financial stability despite ongoing cost pressures.
- **Strategic Recommendations:** The report advises Verizon to improve working capital management, strengthen liquidity through tighter credit controls, and expand into high-margin services such as 5G and enterprise solutions to enhance long-term profitability and financial resilience.

# **Paper 3: Market Ratio Analysis and Stock Valuation**

[FINC 330 Paper 3.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21224068/FINC.330.Paper.3.docx)

- **Objective:** The paper conducts a market value ratio analysis and stock valuation of Verizon Communications Inc. for fiscal year 2024, comparing it to competitor AT&T Inc. to assess relative performance and investment potential.
- **Analytical Methods:** Key market ratios analyzed include Price/Earnings (P/E), Price/Book (P/B), Price/Cash Flow, Forward P/E, Dividend Yield, and Dividends per Share. The study also incorporates analyst ratings and valuation interpretations to determine if Verizon is undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued.
- **Key Findings:** Verizon displayed stronger dividend performance, higher cash flow efficiency, and a lower forward P/E ratio compared to AT&T, suggesting an attractive value for income-focused investors. However, most analyst ratings classified the stock as a “Hold,” signaling modest growth potential in the short term.
- **Strategic Implications:** Based on financial and market indicators, the paper concludes that Verizon is a stable, income-generating investment with moderate upside, best suited for long-term investors prioritizing yield and capital preservation in the telecommunications sector.
