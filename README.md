# Business-Finance-Course-FINC-330-
An exploratory 3-part finance research series for my FINC 330 Business Finance course, part of my Finance major. This project analyzes Verizon’s SEC 10-K reports from the past 3–4 years using financial ratio analysis, trend evaluation, and stock valuation techniques to assess the company’s performance.
